        HARRY POTTER SERIES INSPIRED ME IN THE FOLLOWING WAYS :
        1. The thing you fear most is fear itself. In The Prisoner of Azkaban, Professor Lupin, the Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher, introduces the class to a Boggart. ...
        2.Values over the prize. ...
        3.I can tell the right kind for myself. ...
        4. Be loyal
        ect.
